Hi, I'm a freelance **fullstack web developper**, currently living and working in Paris

I spend my time listening music, taking photographs, drink beers and writing code.

I’m currently unavailable for work, but you can shoot me an email on [linkedin](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/fabienlefrapper) anyway.
