My current area of focus revolves around scraping technologies and React Native. Let's start with these interesting links that helped me recently :
- [Running selenium in docker](https://nander.cc/using-selenium-within-a-docker-container)
- [Setting up React Native Web with Remix](https://horus.dev/blog/react-native-web-remix-setup)
  
PS: If you are curious about the design of this website, the first version was made by [Studio Le Dimanche](https://ledimanche.studio/).
