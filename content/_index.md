I am a French _fullstack_ web **developper**. I write
some code since I discovered the _view source_ feature of Internet
Explorer when I was a kid.
  
Using Python and JavaScript, I try to help companies, non-profit, NGOs
to ship quality software.
  
I currently work full-time with
[L'Ã©tabli](https://letabli.io) and [Astrolabe](https://astrolabe.coop).
  
  
I contribute to [various](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail) [open source](https://github.com/GrappleGQL/wagtail-grapple) [projects](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/). You can find some of my code on [github](https://github.com/fabienheureux).

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:contact@fabienlefrapper.me).
