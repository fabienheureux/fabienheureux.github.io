I am a _fullstack_ engineer living in France.
I write some code since I discovered the _view source_ feature of Internet
Explorer when I was a kid.  
Using Python and JavaScript, I now help public sector, non-profit, NGOs shipping quality software for the public interest, mostly by writing open-source code.

I contribute to [various](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail) [open source](https://github.com/GrappleGQL/wagtail-grapple) [projects](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/). You can find some of my code on [github](https://github.com/fabienheureux).

I recently worked on :

- [SPPNaut](https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/sppnaut.html): geocoding data from the French hydrographic service.
- [WWOOF](https://asso.wwoof.fr): migrate from a classic wordpress website to a headless approach, with a backend connected to the main WWOOFing web application to display news articles on its homepage.
- Visoconso : ingest and aggregate data from gaz and electricity providers in a single interface to easily visualise energy consumptions of public buildings.
- [Terre de Liens](https://terredeliens.org): migrate an old Spip website to a new Wagtail website connected to a SalesForce database.
- [RSF](https://rsf.org/): technical consulting for the rebuild of the website of Reporters Without Borders.
