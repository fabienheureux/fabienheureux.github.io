I am a _fullstack_ engineer living in France, writing some code since I discovered the _view source_ feature of Internet Explorer when I was a kid.

Using Python and JavaScript, I now help public sector, non-profit, NGOs by designing, coding and maintaining quality software.
The code I write is mostly [open-source](https://github.com/fabienheureux).

On my free time, I am also part of a music festival called [Les Nuits Soniques](https://lesnuitssoniques.com) that takes place in a old Chapel from the 13th century in Auray.

I recently worked on :

- [Longue vie aux objets](https://longuevieauxobjets.ademe.fr) : tools based on map and data aiming at improving circular economy in France
- [APiLos](https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/apilos.html) : Ease access to social housing by simplifying paperwork automation
- [SPPNaut](https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/sppnaut.html): geocoding data from the French hydrographic service.
- [Terre de Liens](https://terredeliens.org): migrate an old Spip website to a new Wagtail website connected to a SalesForce database.
- [RSF](https://rsf.org/): technical consulting for the rebuild of the website of Reporters Without Borders.
