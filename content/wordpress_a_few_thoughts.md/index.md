Wordpress is not so popular among developers[^1]. However, its market share[^2] is undebatable.

I had to work with WordPress recently for [WWOOF](https://asso.wwoof.fr)[^3] with a headless setup : 
* Wordpress as a blog and static pages provider  
* a Next.js frontend consuming its data
       
My experience with Wordpress is quite outdated: it dates back to ~2010.   
**I wanted to share a few thoughts about how it felt using it in 2023. This is not a detailed and honest comparison.**

## Documentation is fine, once you found it

First thing : I searched **Wordpress get started** on search engines.   
Almost every result feels like people trying to sell you something. Quite the opposite of most open source communities I am used to.  
Just add **developer** to this query and you will feel at home.

In fact, the _documentation_ is located in the [**developpers** section](https://developer.wordpress.org) of the documentation's website.  
WordPress's primary focus are the editors. It makes sense that what they call a _documentation_ is not the technical documentation. Still, not usual but not an issue per se.
   
Many API reference pages have a comment section in which some people post examples of implementation.  
That is common in php official documentation and can help using an unknown library or function.

## Some great examples...not without errors 

WordPress team provides [official examples in a GitHub repo](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-examples).
  
It seems perfect to get a working local developement setup : 
* Docs are straightforward : `npm run env:start`
* Oops...an error is displayed directly in the console

```php

Let's dig: this example uses [this dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env) to set up a local development environment: a node packageâ€¦that runsâ€¦docker ?  

* WordPress is a php project, that relies on node.js mainly for Gutenberg and assets bundling.  
* Why not just a docker-compose.yml file ? It could be useful to non-nodejs-but-docker-savvy PHP developpers
  
It always feel a bit sketchy some framework obfuscate the underlying technologies behind some of their tools.  
It could easily save them time spent with support request if they just included a `docker-compose.yml` and a few references to docker documentation. 

## ...it escalated quickly...

By checking running containers (`docker ps`), I noticed that the wordpress server was running and accessible on [http://localhost:8888](.).

Let's ignore the error for now and enable the example plugin.   

On the plugins page, a cryptic error is now displayed. 
![A cryptic error displayed in Wordpress' backoffice](./wordpress-weird-stacktrace.png)
Here we find the same stack trace as beforeâ€¦that starts with the word **warning** (?)  
Looking a bit closer, there is a `Fatal Error` message in the middle of the little message at the top of the page.  
You want to see more ? Letâ€™sâ€¦scroll in this small `div` ?  
I canâ€™t believe that they did not find a better way to display a stack trace in the admin. Maybe this is me that did not find it though ðŸ˜¬ ?

After a few minutes spent debugging, I read several GitHub issues and some clear proofs that this package is not properly maintained :   
* [A comment from a developper from Automattic saying that they removed some tests because it added friction to core commits and PRs](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/48678#issuecomment-1453191368)
* [A lot of open issues (49 open vs 71 closed at the time of writing)](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%5BPackage%5D+Env%22)

This is where I gave up.  
I ended up not using this project to set up my local development environment but instead wrote my own `docker-compose.yml`, that is really simple : 

```yml 
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:10.6.4-focal
    command: "--default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=somewordpress
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress
      - MYSQL_USER=wordpress
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpress
    expose:
      - 3306
      - 33060
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - 8000:80
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - WORDPRESS_DEBUG=1
      - WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=db
      - WORDPRESS_DB_USER=wordpress
      - WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=wordpress
      - WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress
    volumes:
      #  This is our custom plugin, you can put yours here
      - ./wordpress/wwoof-blocks/:/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/wwoof-blocks/
      # If you need to customized your php config
      - ./php.ini:/usr/local/etc/php/php.ini
volumes:
  db_data:
```
